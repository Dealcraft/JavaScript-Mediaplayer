# JavaScript-Mediaplayer
Mediaplayer for Mp4 and Mp3

# Get started
First you create a new folder in your root directory. Preferably with the name vid.
Then you download the project and put it into your root directory, then you open the player.js file with an editor such as [Atom](https://atom.io) and jump to the 26th line for the first time.
There you will find an array like in line 27. In line 26 you have to enter the file name + extension. For each file that will be played back later, you have to enter its own quotation marks, separated by a comma.
Then enter in line 27 the titles that should be displayed. It is important to use the same order as in line 26, otherwise the wrong title will be displayed. 
Afterwards you put your files into the folder "vids" that you have created before.
Now just open the index.html and enter the first video or audio at <source>, e.g. "vid/welcome.mp4" or "vid/welcome.mp3" and the system works. For the right style just open the player.css and start styling. This version includes a sample CSS.
I hope you enjoy

IMPORTANT: The IDs of the objects in the HTML file must not be exchanged, otherwise the system will not work!

If you did not name the folder "vid" you have to enter the correct path in line 56, 101, 114 and 172
